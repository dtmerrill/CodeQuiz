# How Well Do You Know JavaScript?

# Why, What and How is it?


## Why?
Sometimes in our lives, information flies at us so fast that we only land on some points for long enough to jump past them - like stones across a stream. But, anyone who has watched a fail video knows that often the stones move or are too far apart or are slippery or are actually turtles, and we end up soaking wet.

This quiz (both written in JavaScript and about JavaScript to double your pleasure) tests some of your knowledge about how it works and its conceptual foundations.

We really don't want to be tripping over any idealistic 'turtles' and end up underwater because we were moving too fast, do we?


## What?
Using information from the early chapters of JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY, Jon Duckett, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2014, this quiz is 10 questions long and combines multiple choice and True/False format with a 'mouse-click' interface. There are three primary representations, a home/welcome screen, the quiz, and a scoreboard, each painted by hiding or showing the different fields or containers desired. The timed quiz randomizes the questions, shows hover state changes, provides immediate "Right/Wrong" feedback, allows entry of name or initial information and holds scores locally until cleared.


## How?
Overall, this is "button-push" interface with many event listeners and switches behind the scenes to drive the code through its paces. Although it brought its own challenges, keeping all of the fields on a single page and hiding/revealing them as needed was a more intriguing way to me and addressing the classes that way was more fun.


## What else do I need to know?
Thanks for asking! It is simple code but I especially like the Right/Wrong feedback as the questions are answered. Also, managing the timer was an interesting effort. The main challenge at the end was in getting local storage of the names/scores to do what I wanted but eventually that was resolved.

I hope you enjoy the quiz and don't find it too simple! Cheers!
